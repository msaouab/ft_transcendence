# PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Add your custom exceptions to the exceptions folder and let others use it.



# COMMON SERVICES (SERVICES THAT ALREADY IMPLEMENTED THAT YOU CAN USE, DRY)
- any service you created and you think others might need put it here.

- To get a user by id, throw an exception if notfound, import `getUserById(id: string): Promise<User>` in the user service.


# Packages Used 

- There's a package called class-validator, that allows us to check if the data sent to the server is valid. we don't want to save invalid data in our database. 
check it https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-validator , it's used in our DTOs to check the validity of the data, and it's used in the service layer to check if the data is valid before saving it in the database. check an example at /invites/dto/post-invite.dto.ts. 

-- **Passport** is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using 42 strategie aka passport-42 check it: https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-42/

- **Express-session** is a middleware that allows you to store session data on the server. It's used to store the user's data in the session, so we can use it in the whole application. check it: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session


# GUIDELINES 

- it's convenient and best practice to document our API, check this https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction on how to document your endpoints.

- When designing your API make this guide as your reference https://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#restful

- for the env variables, make sure you are using the .env file, and not the .env.example file. the .env.example file is just an example of the .env file, and it's used to show the other developers what env variables are needed to run the project.
